### Definition:

The iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

### Explanation:

the iterator design pattern allows us to traverse the container and access each element using a proxy object. This form of decoupling the access and traversal from the container itself allows the use of better traversal algorithms and use of generic interfaces to implement the iterating mechanism.
